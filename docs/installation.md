# Installation
Put the plugin jar file to your `plugin` folder, and restart the server.  

## First Startup
MelonScoop will read all the log files under the `logs` folder generated by the server in the past days, and collect the player login data automatically. Please make sure that there are no unrelated files in the `logs` folder.  

The log files were only needed at the first startup. After collecting the player data, MelonScoop will save all the data into local storage files. After the first startup, MelonScoop will use the created database instead of reading the log files every time.

You can also move all the log files to the other place before the first startup to avoid logging files reading(if you don't like). If so, the IP addresses a player used in the past will not be recorded.  

## Reinstall
If you found something went wrong with the player data records and want to clear all data and reinstall the plugin, please close the server and delete the `MelonScoop` folder under the `plugins` folder, MelonScoop will rescan the log file and build the player database again at the next startup.
